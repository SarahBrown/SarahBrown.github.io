            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am in my senior year as a Computer Engineering major at the University of Oklahoma, where I have
                focused on developing electrical systems during my time on Sooner Competitive Robotics. </p>
        
            <p>Through TAing, robotics competitions, and classes, I have gained experience working on hardware development.</p>

            <p>I am currently planning on graduating with my undegraduate degree Fall 2021 and my master's degree in Spring 2022.</p>

                        During the Summer of 2019, I completed an ECE graduate level class focused on PCB design. This
                        class
                        implemented Altium Designer by completing projects. These projects were small designs and a
                        larger final
                        project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The final project focused on implementing an open source smart watch design. A schematic was
                        provided that I
                        then recreated in Altium Designer. After creating the schematic, I completed the board layout
                        and routing.

                        created with an integrator circuit and indicators of whether the car is on the road.
                        To simulate a car driving down a road, four different subcircuits are interconnected.

                    <p>
                        A simulated robot project for a class challenge focused on designing a robot that would be able
                        to
                        travel down a hallway. The robot would travel down the corridor by “bouncing” as it completed
                        turns between the two walls with the goal of making as
                        many turns as possible.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After reaching a marked distance down the hall, the robot would be
                        switched from automatic mode to a manual controlled mode. In a manual control state, the robot
                        would be steered over a bonus target and driven into one of several destination slots. At the
                        end of the run, the robot would then shut off its motors and blink a LED signaling completion of
                        the course.

                        For the 2019-2020 season I am currently captaining the Mercury competition team. I am leading a
                        group of 20
                        students on different subteams (electrical, mechanical, and software) as we develop a
                        competition ready robot.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This robot is currently under development and we are working to construct autonomous routines,
                        EMF detector
                        circuits, an arm to pick up a small block, a drivetrain chassis, and other necessary components.
                        Shown in the
                        video here is our work as of 10/31/2019.

                        Hacklahoma is a hackathon hosted at the Univesrity of Oklahoma each year. The 2020 theme was
                        related to
                        promoting STEM education. Stemmy.online was my team's entry which won third place.

                        During the Fall of 2019, I completed an ECE class focused on circuit design and implementation
                        with the use
                        of Multisim and EAGLE. The final project of this class centered around PCB design.

                    <p>
                        For the final project I developed a board that would display my school ID number. To implement
                        this design I
                        created a truth table for the different states, simulated it in Multisim, and designed the
                        layout in Eagle.

                        Working together with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second
