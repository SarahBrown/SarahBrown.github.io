            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently finishing up my Master of Science in ECE at the University of Oklahoma.</p>
            <p> During my time at OU, I have gotten the opportunity to lead teams through competitive robotics and
                develop course material as a teaching assistant.</p>

            <p>By working as a teaching assistant, robotics competitions, and classes, I have gained experience working
                on embedded systems and hardware development.</p>

            <p>I earned my Computer Engineering and Mathematics degrees at OU in 2021.</p>

                    <p>A FPGA implementation of a simple neural network to identify numbers trained on the MNIST
                        dataset. By taking the weights and biases of a trained model, it is possible to reconstruct the
                        model for inference purposes on a FPGA. This project showed that reconstructing a neural network
                        was possible and useful as it allowed for the model to be run quickly and independently.

                        a map, the robot then would be able to path plan from its starting location. By continuing to
                        localize, a path can be more accurately planned.

                        During the Spring of 2021, I completed an ECE graduate level class focused on artificial neural

                        This project was motivated by contactless delivery and social distancing due to the Covid-19
                        pandemic. It featured the use of
                        computer vision to create a dataset for a U-Net convolutional neural network model. By creating
                        a dataset from archived
                        security footage, a model is created to predict the delivery of mail. This model can be used to

                        to arrive and for when it is delivered.
