## Overview

### Involvement

### Sooner Competitive Robotics
[Sooner Competitive Robotics] (http://www.ou.edu/scr/) (SCR) is an umbrella organization at the University of Oklahoma which contains separate competitive robotics teams. SCR has given me the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary teams and become a stronger leader.

#### Mercury Competition
Mercury Robotics is a competition hosted annually by Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. This challenge features a teleoperated robot completing a course with a series of obstacles, including going over a bridge and traversing rough terrain.  This competition simulates driving a robot on another planet by making the driver experience internet lag.

During the 2018-2019 season I led the electrical subteam for the Mercury competition team. During this time, I worked to design and implement the necessary electronic subsystems for a competitive robot. Working together with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second highest in the competition.  

I am currently the captain of the 2019-2020 Mercury team. I am leading a team of 20 students on different subteams toward competing at the end of the school year. I work to keep the team on schedule by assigning tasks to the mechanical, electrical, and software subteams and by scheduling design reviews.  In addition to the project management aspects of my role, I am also working with members to develop autonomous subroutines and implementing technology to correctly identify an object emitting a 10 Hz pulse among four different objects.

#### SCR Leadership
In addition to technical aspects, I am also involved with leadership of SCR and am an active officer. As secretary of SCR I organize events on campus for outreach and recruiting.  SCR is actively trying to increase our presence on campus by reaching out to other engineering organizations to co-host events and to volunteer.  I serve as the bridge between SCR and these other organizations and help coordinate events to teach others about robotics. 

### Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering
[Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering] (https://arrc.ou.edu/~wece/) (WECE) is an organization devoted to improving retention rates in the ECE school at OU and outreach to increase the number of women in ECE and STEM fields. With WECE I have planned events for students in the ECE department focused on educational and social opportunities. These events include soldering nights where our group teaches others the basic of soldering, lab nights where we teach the basics of breadboarding and lab equipment, and advising nights where we bring in professors in the ECE and CS departments to discuss classes with students.

### Engineers' Club
The mission of [Engineersâ€™ Club] (http://eclub.ou.edu/) is to promote a sense of community across all engineering and science disciplines through purposeful programming aimed at social and personal growth.  As an Engineers' Club officer I help to plan and organize events as well as helping at homegame tailgates.
