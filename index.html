      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am in my senior year as a Computer Engineering major at the University of Oklahoma, where I have
        focused on developing electrical systems during my time on Sooner Competitive Robotics. </p>

      <p>Through TAing, robotics competitions, and classes, I have gained experience working on hardware development.</p>

      <p>I am currently planning on graduating with my undegraduate degree Fall 2021 and my master's degree in Spring 2022.</p>

                Worked remotely as a teaching assistant for the digital design class in the ECE department at the
                University of Oklahoma. This position centered on supervising several lab sections via Zoom and
                debugging issues that
                students faced. In addition to providing in-lab support, I redesigned existing labs so that students
                could complete them remotely with an ESP32 module. This included writing C/C++ code for the ESP32s and
                rewriting documents. The code written focused on ease of use and autotesting to make grading easier.

              <p>
                Worked remotely as an electrical engineering intern at Gecko Robotics. Developing methods to contactlessly detect defects on objects such as pipes, this process centered on
                utilizing laser scanning and computer vision. Project required Python and OpenCV skills.

              <h1>Robotics</h1>
              <p>
                Sooner Competitive Robotics (SCR) is an umbrella organization at the University of Oklahoma which
                contains separate competitive robotics teams.
                SCR has given me the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary teams and become a stronger leader.
              </p>

              <h2>Mercury Competition</h2>
              <p>
                Mercury Robotics is a competition hosted annually by Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. This
                challenge features a teleoperated robot completing a course with a series of obstacles, including going
                over a bridge and traversing rough terrain. This competition simulates driving a robot on another planet by
                making the driver experience communication lag.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the 2018-2019 season I led the electrical subteam for the Mercury competition team. During this
                time, I worked to design and implement the necessary electronic subsystems for a competitive robot. Working
                together with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second highest in the competition.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the 2019-2020 season I was the captain of the Mercury team. I led a team of 15 students on
                different
                subteams toward competing at the end of the school year, although due to covid our competition was
                unfortunately canceled. I worked to keep the team on schedule by assigning tasks
                to the mechanical, electrical, and software subteams and by scheduling design reviews. In addition to
                the project management aspects of my role, I also worked with members to develop autonomous subroutines
                and implemented technology to correctly identify an object emitting a 10 Hz pulse among four different
                objects.
              </p>

              <h2>SCR Leadership</h2>
              <p>
                In addition to technical aspects, I am also involved with leadership of SCR and am an active officer. I
                am currently serving as the president of SCR. As president I work to coordinate our different teams on
                various levels and contribute as an active member on all teams.
                Previously I served in other officer roles and worked to organize events on campus for outreach and
                recruiting. SCR is actively trying to increase our presence on campus by reaching out to other engineering organizations
                to co-host events and to volunteer. I worked as the bridge between SCR and these other organizations and
                help coordinate events to teach others about robotics.

              <p>
                Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE) is an organization devoted to improving retention
                rates in the ECE school at OU and increasing the number of women in ECE and STEM fields. With WECE I
                have planned events for students in the ECE department focused on educational and social opportunities. These
                events include soldering nights where our group teaches others the basic of soldering, lab nights where
                we teach the basics of breadboarding and lab equipment, and advising nights where we bring in professors in the ECE
                and CS departments to discuss classes with students.
