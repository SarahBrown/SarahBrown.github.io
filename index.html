      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I recently finished my Master of Science in ECE at the University of Oklahoma.</p>
      <p> During my time at OU, I got the opportunity to lead teams through competitive robotics and develop
        course material as a teaching assistant.</p>

      <p>By working as a teaching assistant, competing in robotics competitions, and learning from classes, I
        gained experience working on embedded systems and hardware development. From my graduate course I 
        gained skills and experience in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>

      <p>I earned my Computer Engineering and Mathematics degrees at OU in 2021.</p>

              <h1>University of Oklahoma - Fall 2020-Fall 2022</h1>
              <p>
                Worked remotely as a teaching assistant in the ECE department at the University of Oklahoma for digital
                design and computer architecture. Provided students assistance during office hours and lab sessions as
                well as graded assignments. Labs sessions were remote lab sections with 10-20 students per section where
                I provided real-time problem resolution and debugging assistance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developed labs and code for ESP32s/Arduinos so students could complete Digital Design labs remotely.
                This included writing code for the ESP32s and rewriting documents. The code written focused on ease of
                use and autotesting to make grading easier. In addition to redesigning labs for remote access, I worked
                on the digital design course material to improve hands-on learning and improve retention in the ECE
                majors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developed labs and code for a computer hardware course centered around FPGAs to increase the rigor of the course 
                and help students connect industrial ideas to content that they were learning.
                This included prototyping the lab assignments according to provided specifications, adjusting
                requirements after the prototypes were complete to make sure that the assignment would be able to be
                completed, and writing up the assignment and rubric. The labs written were focused on serial
                communication between the computer and FPGA via UART.

              <h1>Gecko Robotics - Summer 2020</h1>
              <p>
                Worked remotely as an electrical engineering intern at Gecko Robotics. Developing methods to
                contactlessly detect defects on objects such as pipes, this process centered on
                utilizing laser scanning and computer vision. Project required Python and OpenCV skills.

              <h1>Robotics</h1>
              <p>
                Sooner Competitive Robotics (SCR) is an umbrella organization at the University of Oklahoma which
                contains separate competitive robotics teams.
                SCR has given me the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary teams and become a stronger leader.
              </p>

              <h2>IGVC</h2>
              <p>
                IGVC, the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition, is a competition centered on creating
                autonomous robots that can navigate a course with lanes and obstacles. One area of improvement
                centered on robot localization. In particular, making the robot's heading converge. I used a
                particle filter system, with use of Numpy and Pandas for data management, to determine which way
                the robot was moving.
              </p>

              <h2>Mercury Competition</h2>
              <p>
                Mercury Robotics is a competition hosted annually by Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. This
                challenge features a teleoperated robot completing a course with a series of obstacles, including going
                over a bridge and traversing rough terrain. This competition simulates driving a robot on another planet
                by
                making the driver experience communication lag.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the 2019-2020 season I was the captain of the Mercury team. I led a team of 15 students on
                different
                subteams toward competing at the end of the school year, although due to covid our competition was
                unfortunately canceled. I worked to keep the team on schedule by assigning tasks
                to the mechanical, electrical, and software subteams and by scheduling design reviews. In addition to
                the project management aspects of my role, I also worked with members to develop autonomous subroutines
                and implemented technology to correctly identify an object emitting a 10 Hz pulse among four different
                objects.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the 2018-2019 season I led the electrical subteam for the Mercury competition team. During this
                time, I worked to design and implement the necessary electronic subsystems for a competitive robot.
                Working
                together with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second highest in the
                competition.
              </p>

              <h2>SCR Leadership</h2>
              <p>
                In addition to technical aspects, I was also involved with leadership of SCR. I served as the president
                of SCR.
                As president I work to coordinate our different teams on various levels and contribute as an active
                member on all teams.
                Previously I served in other officer roles and worked to organize events on campus for outreach and
                recruiting. SCR is actively trying to increase our presence on campus by reaching out to other
                engineering organizations
                to co-host events and to volunteer. I worked as the bridge between SCR and these other organizations and
                help coordinate events to teach others about robotics.

              <p>
                Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE) is an organization devoted to improving retention
                rates in the ECE school at OU and increasing the number of women in ECE and STEM fields. With WECE I
                have planned events for students in the ECE department focused on educational and social opportunities.
                These events included soldering nights where our group teaches others the basic of soldering, lab nights
                where
                we taught the basics of breadboarding and lab equipment, and advising nights where we brought in
                professors
                in the ECE and CS departments to discuss classes with students.
