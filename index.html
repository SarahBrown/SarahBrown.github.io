      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img style="width: 100%" src="assets\img\mainPic.png"></img>
      <p>I am in my senior year as a Computer Engineering major at the University of Oklahoma, where I have focused on
        developing electrical systems during
        my time on Sooner Competitive Robotics.
        Through robotics competitions and classes, I have gained experience working on hardware development.</p>

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <img style="width: 100%" src="assets\img\TA.png"></img>
      <h3>University of Oklahoma - Fall 2020/Spring 2021</h3>
      <p>Worked remotely as a teaching assistant for the digital design class in the ECE department at the University of
        Oklahoma. This position centered on supervising several lab sections via Zoom and debugging issues that students
        faced. In addition to providing in lab support, I redesigned existing labs so that students could complete them
        remotely with an ESP32 module. This included writing C/C++ code for the ESP32s and rewriting documents. The code
        written focused on ease of use and autotesting to make grading easier.</p>

      <h3>Gecko Robotics - Summer 2020</h3>
      <p>Worked remotely as an electrical engineering intern at Gecko Robotics. During my time at Gecko I worked on
        developing methods to contactlessly detect defects on objects such as pipes, this process centered on laser
        scanning and computer vision. This project let me learn a lot about Python and OpenCV.

      <h2>Involvement</h2>

      <h3>Robotics</h3>
      <p>Sooner Competitive Robotics (SCR) is an umbrella organization at the University of Oklahoma which contains
        separate competitive robotics teams.
        SCR has given me the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary teams and become a stronger leader.</p>
      <h4>Mercury Competition</h4>
      <p>Mercury Robotics is a competition hosted annually by Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. This
        challenge features a teleoperated robot completing a course with a series of obstacles, including going over a
        bridge and traversing rough terrain. This competition simulates driving a robot on another planet by making the
        driver experience internet lag.</p>

      <p>During the 2018-2019 season I led the electrical subteam for the Mercury competition team. During this time, I
        worked to design and implement the necessary electronic subsystems for a competitive robot. Working together
        with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second highest in the competition. </p>

      <p>During the 2019-2020 season I was the captain of the Mercury team. I led a team of 15 students on different
        subteams toward competing at the end of the school year, although due to covid our competition was unfortunately
        canceled. I worked to keep the team on schedule by assigning tasks
        to the mechanical, electrical, and software subteams and by scheduling design reviews. In addition to the
        project management aspects of my role, I am also worked with members to develop autonomous subroutines and
        implemented technology to correctly identify an object emitting a 10 Hz pulse among four different objects.</p>

      <h4>SCR Leadership</h4>
      <p>In addition to technical aspects, I am also involved with leadership of SCR and am an active officer. I am
        currently serving as the president of SCR. As president I work to coordinate our different teams on various
        levels and contribute as an active member on all teams.
        Previously I served as the secretary and worked to organize events on campus for outreach and recruiting. SCR is
        actively trying to increase our presence on campus by reaching out to other engineering organizations to co-host
        events and to volunteer. I worked as the bridge between SCR and these other organizations and help coordinate
        events to teach others about robotics. </p>

      <h3>Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering</h3>
      <p>Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE) is an organization devoted to improving retention rates in
        the ECE school at OU and outreach to increase the number of women in ECE and STEM fields. With WECE I have
        planned events for students in the ECE department focused on educational and social opportunities. These events
        include soldering nights where our group teaches others the basic of soldering, lab nights where we teach the
        basics of breadboarding and lab equipment, and advising nights where we bring in professors in the ECE and CS
        departments to discuss classes with students.</p>
