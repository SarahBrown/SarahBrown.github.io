      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img style = "width: 100%" src="assets\img\mainPic.png"></img>
      <p>I am in my senior year as a Computer Engineering major at the University of Oklahoma, where I have focused on developing electrical systems during
           my time on Sooner Competitive Robotics.  
          Through robotics competitions and classes, I have gained experience working on hardware development.</p>

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <img style="width: 100%" src="assets\img\gecko.png"></img>
      <h3>Gecko Robotics - Summer 2020</h3>
      <p>Worked remotely as an electircal engineering intern at Gecko Robotics.  During my time at Gecko I worked on developing methods to contactlessly detect defects.  This process centered on laser scanning and computer vision. </p>

      <h3>Robotics</h3>
      <p>Sooner Competitive Robotics (SCR) is an umbrella organization at the University of Oklahoma which contains separate competitive robotics teams. 
          SCR has given me the opportunity to work on interdisciplinary teams and become a stronger leader.</p>
        <h4>Mercury Competition</h4>
      <p>Mercury Robotics is a competition hosted annually by Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. This challenge features a teleoperated robot completing a course with a series of obstacles, including going over a bridge and traversing rough terrain.  This competition simulates driving a robot on another planet by making the driver experience internet lag.</p>

        <p>During the 2018-2019 season I led the electrical subteam for the Mercury competition team. During this time, I worked to design and implement the necessary electronic subsystems for a competitive robot. Working together with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second highest in the competition. </p>
            
        <p>I am currently the captain of the 2019-2020 Mercury team. I am leading a team of 20 students on different subteams toward competing at the end of the school year. I work to keep the team on schedule by assigning tasks to the mechanical, electrical, and software subteams and by scheduling design reviews.  In addition to the project management aspects of my role, I am also working with members to develop autonomous subroutines and implementing technology to correctly identify an object emitting a 10 Hz pulse among four different objects.</p>

        <h4>SCR Leadership</h4>
        <p>In addition to technical aspects, I am also involved with leadership of SCR and am an active officer. I am currently serving as the president of SCR. As president I work to coordinate our different teams on various levels and contribute as an active member on all teams.
          Previously I served as the secretary and worked to organize events on campus for outreach and recruiting.  SCR is actively trying to increase our presence on campus by reaching out to other engineering organizations to co-host events and to volunteer.  I worked as the bridge between SCR and these other organizations and help coordinate events to teach others about robotics. </p>

      <h2>Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering</h2>
      <p>Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering (WECE) is an organization devoted to improving retention rates in the ECE school at OU and outreach to increase the number of women in ECE and STEM fields. With WECE I have planned events for students in the ECE department focused on educational and social opportunities. These events include soldering nights where our group teaches others the basic of soldering, lab nights where we teach the basics of breadboarding and lab equipment, and advising nights where we bring in professors in the ECE and CS departments to discuss classes with students.</p>
