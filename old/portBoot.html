      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img style = "width: 100%" src="assets\img\mainPic.png"></img>
      <p>I am in my senior year as a Computer Engineering major at the University of Oklahoma, where I have focused on developing electrical systems during
           my time on Sooner Competitive Robotics.  
          Through robotics competitions and classes, I have gained experience working on hardware development.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>ECE 5973 PCB Design Classwork</h3>
      <img style="width: 100%" src="assets\img\finalProjectPCBGradClass.png"></img>
      <p>During the Summer of 2019, I completed an ECE graduate level class focused on PCB design.  This class implemented Altium Designer by completing projects.  These projects were small designs and a larger final project.  
        The final project focused on implementing an open source smart watch design. A schematic was provided that I then recreated in Altium Designer.  After creating the schematic, I completed the board layout and routing. </p>

      </video>
      <p>During the Fall of 2019, I completed an ECE class focused on circuit design and implementation with the use of Multisim and EAGLE. The final project of this class centered around PCB design.
        For the final project I developed a board that would display my school ID number.  To implement this design I created a truth table for the different states, simulated it in Multisim, and designed the layout in Eagle. </p>

          </video>
        <p>For the 2019-2020 season I am currently captaining the Mercury competition team.  I am leading a group of 20 students on different subteams (electrical, mechanical, and software) as we develop a competition ready robot.  
          This robot is currently under development and we are working to construct autonomous routines, EMF detector circuits, an arm to pick up a small block, a drivetrain chassis, and other necessary components.  Shown in the video here is our work as of 10/31/2019. </p>

      <h3>Hacklahoma 2020</h3>
      <img style="width: 100%" src="assets\img\stemmy.png"></img>
      <p>Hacklahoma is a hackathon hosted at the Univesrity of Oklahoma each year.  The 2020 theme was related to promoting STEM education.  Stemmy.online was my team's entry which won third place.  </p>

      <h3>Mercury Robotics 2019</h3>
      <img style="width: 100%" src="assets\img\mercury2019.png"></img>
        <p>During the 2018-2019 season I led the electrical subteam for the Mercury competition team. During this time, I worked to design and implement the necessary electronic subsystems for a competitive robot. 
            Working together with our other subteams (mechanical and software), our team scored second highest in the competition. </p>
